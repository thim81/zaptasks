# ZapTasks

ZapTasks is a modern, user-friendly command execution tool, designed as an alternative to Cron. It simplifies task configuration, execution, and tracking, all while offering a clean interface and seamless integration into macOS.

ZapTasks is built in Swift, delivering a native experience for Mac users, and leverages "Shaas" (Shell as a Service) to execute shell commands.

## Features

* User-Friendly Interface: Configure and manage tasks with ease through a Mac application and menu bar interface.
* Task Execution History: View and track previously executed tasks.
* Notifications: Stay informed with alerts when tasks are executed or completed.
* Mac Integration: Operates smoothly as a Mac menu bar app and standalone application.
* Shell executing: Executes commands efficiently using the powerful Shaas binary "Shell as a Service."
